Usage Notes,"ICPSR recommends that there should be between 5 and 10 subject terms, with 15 as a maximum.

Subject terms are validated against the ICPSR thesaurus, and this field does have a dropdown menu.

Non-thesaurus terms are not necessarily forbidden. If a curator submits a non-thesaurus term, the metadata librarian will gauge the necessity of this term, check it against the Library of Congress Subject Headings to see if a different related term should be used, and consider it for addition to the ICPSR thesaurus."
