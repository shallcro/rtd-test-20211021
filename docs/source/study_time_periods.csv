Usage Notes,"In the Time Period(s) field you can enter a date or range of dates. The time period generally corresponds to the dates that appear in the Study Title. Days and months may be included in the Time Period(s) field even though they are not in the Study Title. The study time period should focus on the dates the data is actually about, regardless of when the data was collected.

Curators can list a year (YYYY), a year plus a month (YYYY-MM), or a year, month, and day (YYYY-MM-DD). Curators can list a range of years (YYYY--YYYY), a range of months (YYYY-MM--YYYY-MM), or a range of days (YYYY-MM-DD--YYYY-MM-DD).

There should be one hyphen between parts of a date, and two hyphens separating two dates. There should not be spaces at all.

When the study is inclusive of a whole month or whole year, the date does not need to be written out as a range.

Time frames should not be used if the date can be expressed exclusively through numbers, and should only be used to add context or for date ranges that cannot be represented in numbers, such as seasons or other units of time where the data producer did not clarify the exact dates they meant."
